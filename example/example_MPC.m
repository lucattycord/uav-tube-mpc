% Unlike tube-MPC, this generic MPC doesn't guarantee the robustness. 
% In the following simulation you will notice that the generated path almost touch the boundary.
% Thus, you can imagine that if some additive disturbance is considered, then the state can 
% easily be off the boundary, and the succeeding optimization will no longer be feasible.
% Please add some noise and do experiments.
